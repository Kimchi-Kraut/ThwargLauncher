ThwargLauncher ToDO - This is a list of priority items to be fixed/added with the Launcher

 - Make the Onlogin Commands work on a per-profile basis. So you can set up a profile and have different launch options.
     Login commands are stored in filenames by account & server & character, so add profile to filename
        Method LoginCommandPersister.GetFilepath
     And need to pass profile name in launch file
         LaunchControl.RecordLaunchInfo
         LaunchControl.GetLaunchInfo

 - Add a checkbox to user editor called "Group Launches by Server" which launches all accounts by priority and server name, and continues rather than launching all servers of an account, and then the next account
 
 - command line launch with profile

 - Research why AutoRelaunch is used to control CheckForProgramUpdate

 - Need a way to search for a character name in the list of accounts to figure out what account needs logged in to get to that character


Before we delete the game file, read the file and check the server name. If it has any weird info, we can verify that against info we have set up.
